# holiday-manager

This application was created and meant to be run on the command line via the holiday_startercode.py file.

This project was written in Python 3.9 and that is the reccommended version for the repository.

# Inlcuded:

There is a .gitignore that ignores the config file. Though the file itself lacks sensitive information without there being an api key.

Two starting files included are holidays.json which comes preloaded with some holidays inside and savedholidays.json where saved holidays will be stored.

There is a flowchart of the initial plans, but admittedly it did not go quite according to them.
